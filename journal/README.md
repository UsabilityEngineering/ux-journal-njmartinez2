# Placing Chunk by Chunk

As someone who plays minecraft a whole lot, I have played a lot of worlds that meant a lot to me, which is why I use [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/) for editing those worlds and placing chunks in other worlds. Amulet Editor allows for easy and simple world editing, although it sometimes hard to use, and with how the app looks, it makes me want to help make the gui look better.
