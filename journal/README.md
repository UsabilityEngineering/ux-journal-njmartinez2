# Placing Chunk by Chunk

As someone who plays Minecraft a lot, I’ve had many worlds that meant a great deal to me. That’s why I use the [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/)—a powerful tool for editing Minecraft worlds and moving chunks between them. Amulet makes world editing relatively simple, though at times it can be difficult to use. The current GUI could use some improvements, which has inspired me to get involved and help make it better.

Chunks are portions of a Minecraft region file that define areas in the world. They store data about block types, entities (like mobs), and block inventories (like chests). Amulet Editor provides both a map and a 3D interface that allow users to interact with their worlds in an intuitive and familiar way. The map viewer resembles the in-game Minecraft map, while the 3D view feels similar to spectator mode.

In Amulet, it’s common to delete or copy chunks from a world. Chunks are selected in square regions that are 16x16 blocks in size. Like many programs, Amulet supports standard shortcuts—**Ctrl + C** to copy and **Ctrl + V** to paste—which makes it easy for users familiar with those conventions. You can also paste chunks using a dedicated button. The program highlights selected and placeable chunks using a clear blue overlay, making it easy to see which areas are safe to modify.

Deleting chunks is also straightforward. This is useful when you want to clear an area—whether to undo damage caused by a wither, or just to make room for something new.

Empty areas—also known as nonexistent chunks—are places the player hasn’t visited yet. If you try to paste chunks into these areas, the game won’t generate terrain to fill the gaps around them. Instead, it simply won’t load anything. This can be frustrating, especially if you're working with an old or important world. 

If a broken or missing area appears, recovery can be difficult unless you’ve made a backup beforehand. That’s why it’s important to be cautious when placing chunks into unvisited or disconnected areas. Without a backup, there’s no easy way to **recover from the error**—potentially losing parts of your world.
